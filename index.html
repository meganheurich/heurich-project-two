  <p>
      Last summer, I had the opportunity to explore multiple Asian countries
      over the course of three months. Stops included Indonesia, Cambodia,
      Thailand & Japan, along with a one month stay in Osaka, Japan to work
      on a study abroad research project with the Illinois Institute of
      Technology. This webpage serves as a resource guide to those who are
      interested in visiting these locations. Below are the highlights and most
      memorable moments during my travels.
