    Last summer, I had the opportunity to explore multiple Asian countries
    over the course of three months. Stops included Indonesia, Cambodia,
    Thailand & Japan, along with a one month stay in Osaka, Japan to work
    on a study abroad research project with the Illinois Institute of
    Technology. This webpage serves as a resource guide to those who are
    interested in visiting these locations. Below are the highlights and most
    memorable moments during my travels.
