    Last summer, I had the opportunity to explore multiple Asian countries
    over the course of three months. Stops included Indonesia, Cambodia,
    Thailand & Japan, along with a one month stay in Osaka, Japan to work
    on a study abroad research project with the Illinois Institute of
    Technology. This webpage serves as a resource guide to those who are
    interested in visiting these locations. Below are the highlights and most
    memorable moments during my travels.

        <figcaption>Photo of Angkor Wat, Cambodia during sunrise. Angkor Wat is
        located in Siem Reap, Cambodia and is the largest religious monument in
        the world. I booked my personal driver and tours through
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DriverSrey/">Driver Srey:
          The Women Drivers of Siem Reap.</a></figcaption>

      circle to create a piece of art on the ground.">
        <figcaption>Phare, the Cambodian Circus, is also located in Siem Reap.
        Preformers combine therater, music, dance and acrobatics to tell
        traditional stories. Tickets start at $18 (USD) & can be purchased
        <a href="https://pharecircus.org/tickets/">here.</a> All funds support
        Cambodian youth in education, professional arts & social support.

  <h2>Chiang Mai Night Market</h2>

      alt="Photo of the Chiang Mai Night Market in Thailand. A crowd of people
      walking through the streets as the sun sets. Tents with vendors line the
      edges of the sidewalk.">
        <figcaption>The famous Chiang Mai Night Market is held Sundays from
        4pm to midnight. Here you can find food, listen to live music and barter
        for unique items. It is popular for tourists and locals alike. For more
        information, check out this

  <h2>Phi Phi Island</h2>

      src="locationphotos/phiphi.jpg"
      alt="Photo of Phi Phi island, Thailand. Long-tail boats float on crystal
      blue water with green mountains in the background.">
        <figcaption>Phi Phi Island is one of the many islands off the coast
        of Thailand. If you're looking for a more laid-back, less party-filled
        island Phi Phi is it. It's best to fly into Krabi or Phuket & take a
        ferry from there. I highly recommend bartering for an island hopping day
        tour!</figcaption>

      alt="Photo of a temple at night in Koyasan. A traditional Japanese
      temple is lined with many small lanterns.">
        <figcaption>Koyasan is a popular destination to visit if you are
          interested in <a href="http://eng.shukubo.net/">spending the night</a>
          in a Buddhist temple. Also home to a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Mount
          Koya is a great place to go if you want to escape the crowded cities.

      the mountains.">
        <figcaption>Takayama is another less populated town. Takayama is known
        for its carpentry and architecture. I highly recommend
        <a href=

        Ebisu</a> for soba noodles. The restaurant provides a cartoon book in
        multiple languages to teach customers how to properly eat soba!</figcaption>
